= SimpleChat

This a sample rails4 engine.  It started as a place to experiment with Server Side Events. Specifically to have a sandbox to explore the bug identified here https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10989

I've repurposed it to provide code samples to interested parties.

#Running the engine

```
    cd specs/dummy
	bundle exec puma -p 3000 -S ~/puma -C config/puma.rb
```
Then open http://localhost:3000/simple_chat/rooms
